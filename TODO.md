# To Do List

* Maybe I need find a way to fix the bug on windows: `clangd` not found standard header files like `stdio.h` etc.
* Try the plugin [neoclip](https://github.com/matveyt/neoclip.git) to fix the bug: `No clipboard tool found`.
* Support `powershell` for lsp.
* Support `powershell` for builtin terminal.
* Maybe I need the plugin [vim-doge](https://github.com/kkoomen/vim-doge.git) to generate document during coding.
* Maybe I will use the plugin [cmp-git](https://github.com/petertriho/cmp-git.git) for git completion.
* Maybe I need select one of the plugins to use `dotnet` to develop `C#` programs:
    * [dotnet.nvim](https://github.com/MoaidHathot/dotnet.nvim.git)
    * [easy-dotnet.nvim](https://github.com/GustavEikaas/easy-dotnet.nvim.git)
* Maybe I need the plugin [numToStr/Comment.nvim](https://github.com/numToStr/Comment.nvim.git) to handle comments.
* Maybe I need the plugin [todo-comments.nvim](https://github.com/folke/todo-comments.nvim.git) to search todo comments.
* Maybe I need use the plugin [cmake-tools.nvim](https://github.com/Civitasv/cmake-tools.nvim.git) to use cmake to build code on neovim.
* Maybe I will replace the plugin `markdown-preview.nvim` with [peek.nvim](https://github.com/toppair/peek.nvim.git) to preview markdown files.
