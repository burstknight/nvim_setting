# To Do List

* I want to use a plugin as a file browser.
    * [oil.nvim](https://github.com/stevearc/oil.nvim.git)
    * [neo-tree.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-neo-tree/neo-tree.nvim.git)
    * [mini.files](https://github.com/echasnovski/mini.files.git)
    * [Rnvimr](https://github.com/kevinhwang91/rnvimr.git)
    * [netrw.nvim](https://github.com/prichrd/netrw.nvim.git)
    * [ranger.nvim](https://github.com/kelly-lin/ranger.nvim.git)
    * [chadtree](https://github.com/ms-jpq/chadtree.git)
* Maybe I need find a way to fix the bug on windows: `clangd` not found standard header files like `stdio.h` etc.
* Fix the bug on windows for failing to install some language server: `ruff-lsp`.
* Try the plugin [neoclip](https://github.com/matveyt/neoclip.git) to fix the bug: `No clipboard tool found`.
* Support `powershell` for lsp.
* Support `powershell` for builtin terminal.
* Maybe I need the plugin [vim-doge](https://github.com/kkoomen/vim-doge.git) to generate document during coding.
* I want to support `C#` for lsp because maybe I need use neovim to develop `C#` application.
