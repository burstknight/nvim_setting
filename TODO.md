# To Do List

* File browser
* Maybe I need find a way to fix the bug on windows: `clangd` not found standard header files like `stdio.h` etc.
* Fix the bug on windows for failing to install some language server: `ruff-lsp`.
* Try the plugin [neoclip](https://github.com/matveyt/neoclip.git) to fix the bug: `No clipboard tool found`.
* Support `powershell` for lsp.
* Support `powershell` for builtin terminal.
* Maybe I should replace [vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline.git) with [lualine.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim.git) for the status bar.
