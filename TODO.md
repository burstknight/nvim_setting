# To Do List

* File browser
* Offer python script to init neovim for windows and linux.
* Maybe I need find a way to fix the bug on windows: `clangd` not found standard header files like `stdio.h` etc.
* Fix the bug on windows for failing to install some language server: `ruff-lsp`.
* Maybe I need replease `choco` with `scoop` as the package manager on windows because `scoop` dosen't need superuser right.
* Add the plugin [leetcode.nvim](https://github.com/kawre/leetcode.nvim.git) to practice leetcode on neovim.
* Fix the bug for clipboard.
