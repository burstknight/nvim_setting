# To Do List

* File browser
* Offer python script to init neovim for windows and linux.
* Maybe I need find a way to fix the bug on windows: `clangd` not found standard header files like `stdio.h` etc.
* Fix the bug on windows for failing to install some language server: `ruff-lsp`.
* Add the plugin [leetcode.nvim](https://github.com/kawre/leetcode.nvim.git) to practice leetcode on neovim.
* Fix the bug for clipboard.
* Support powershell.
* Maybe I should replace [vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline.git) with [lualine.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim.git) for the status bar.
