# nvim_setting
This repo is my neovim setting.

## Requirements
Neovim version must be `0.10+`. 

Some plugins need use `nerd font`, so we need download a font from [this web](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads). And then decompress the downloaded compressed file. Finally, please copy `*.ttf` files into the path `/usr/local/share/fonts`.

You can read [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md) to get more information to setup neovim.
